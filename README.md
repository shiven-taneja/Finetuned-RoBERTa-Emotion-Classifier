# Finetuned-RoBERTa-Emotion-Classifier
Emotion Classifier with 94% accuracy on Twitter messages with six fundamental emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise.

I have been completing the [Practical Deep Learning For Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course by [Fast.AI](https://fast.ai). In the fourth lesson, we started diving into Natural Language Processing (NLP). I wanted to expand on this knowledge and take it one step further and do multi-label classification while also getting familiar with [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) .
